# Converting a java ledger backend into go

This is a small project to create a simple go based http server that can
run locally to support a java-script and XSLT based bookkeeping software.

Since the original software was written with java servlets, it inherits some
old techniques that will eventually be replaced.

Running the software

Pending changes:
- Add the XSLT transformer/stylesheet processor
- Add Authorization layer
